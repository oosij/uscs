Chicago SRW futures stayed above their low on Monday, but gave back 6 3/4 to 12 3/4 cents by the close. KC wheat futures ended nearly a dime off their low, which was a new low for the week, but still down by 5 to 10 1/4 cents. Front month spring wheat prices were also off their lows at the close, but settled 2 1/4 to 5 cents weaker on the day.\\xa0USDA’s Export Sales report showed 155,534 MT of wheat was sold during the week that ended 11/24.

Weekly export sales were on the lower end of trade ideas, and so were the EPA mandates for corn based ethanol use in 2023-25.\\xa0USDA’s monthly Grain Crushing report showed 448.895 mbu of corn was used for ethanol during October. That was up 17% from September’s pull, but down 4% yr/yr. With that, 1.745m tons of DDGS were produced, and 186,770 tons of corn oil – a 3-mo high.\\xa0USDA reported a private export sale of 114,300 MT of 22/23 corn to Mexico. Weekly FAS data showed 602.7k MT of corn was sold during the week that ended 11/24. That was down from 1.85 MMT the week prior and was 59% of the sale made during the same week last year. Mexico was the week’s top buyer with 387k MT, and they also booked 30k MT for new crop. Mexico and China were the top destinations for the week’s 344k MT of exports. Accumulated shipments sat at 5.773 MMT (227 mbu) as of 11/24.\\xa0EPA’s updated biofuels ruling suggests 15b gallons of ethanol will be required under the new quotas in 2023, with a very small increase by 2025.\\xa0Dec 22 Corn\\xa0\\xa0closed at $6.50, down 12 cents,Nearby Cash\\xa0\\xa0 was $6.67 7/8, down 10 cents,Mar 23 Corn\\xa0\\xa0closed at $6.60 1/2, down 6 1/2 cents,May 23 Corn\\xa0\\xa0closed at $6.59 1/4, down 6 cents,\\nOn the date of publication, Alan Brugler did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

       "  'Soymeal futures bounced in the afternoon and ended the session with 0.7% to 0.9% gains. Beans and soybean oil futures on the other hand fell sharply and settled near their lows for the day. At the close BO prices were down by their 450 point limits on +6% losses. Dec oil closed 9.08% lower with no daily limit when contracts are in the delivery process. Soybeans fell 2.1% to 2.7% on the day, taking Jan back to the week’s open.\\xa0Canadian Canola Prices participated in the sell-off on Thursday, dropping 3.6% on the day and giving back most of the week’s earlier gains.NASS confirmed 196.64 mbu of soybeans were processed during October. That was above the average of pre-report estimates (195.9), was up 17.33% from September, and was just 0.8% below the all time record. Soybean oil stocks were 2.094b lbs. The trade was looking for 2.107b ahead of the report.\\xa0The EPA boosted required biofuel use to 20.82b gallons of renewable fuels for 2023, of which 5.82 billion would be advanced biofuels (mostly from soy oil). The prior requirement was 20.63b gallons, so the 2023 number is just a ~1% increase. ASA and other farm groups are disappointed by the minimal increases, as well as some loopholes in RIN creation.\\xa0Weekly Export Sales from the week that ended 11/24 were confirmed at 693,838 MT. Analysts were expecting to see at least 550k MT. China was the top buyer, with 110k MT previously announced. China was also the destination for over half (71%) of the week’s export shipments, which totaled 2.1 MMT to all destinations. The accumulated soybean export reached 19 MMT (700.5 mbu) through 11/24.FAS data had soymeal sales at 185k MT, compared to 516k MT last week and\\xa0 150 – 500k MT expected. Accumulated soymeal exports were 1.494 MMT through 11/24, trailing last year by 19.3%. For BO the weekly report showed 2,306 MT of net cancelations, compared to pre-report estimates of 0-20k MT.

Just comprehensive, common-sense guidance at a great value.Learn more: https://www.totalfarmmarketing.com/tfm-cash-plus/CORN HIGHLIGHTS: Corn futures suffered double-digit losses on front month Dec which gave up 12 cents on the session to finish at 6.50, its lowest close since August 25. Mar lost 6-1/2 to end the day at 6.60-1/2. Dec 2023 closed at 6.01-1/4 down 5-1/4 cents. Sharp losses of near 40 cents in soybeans and wheat giving up 8 to 12 cents weighed on corn futures, despite the dollar trading to its lowest level since August. Concerns about bio-energy use won’t be as large as anticipated after the EPA made announcements of mandates had bears on the offensive.Export sales at 23.7 mb are slow and need to pick up soon to avoid a line-item adjustment downward on USDA WASDE reports. There is not a yield estimate on the December report, but a final estimate will be in January. The December report will include line-item adjustments. Many feel an export reduction is likely on the next report, however, if there is one, we expect it will be small. Snug world supplies and high prices historically are creating a just-in-time inventory approach by importing countries. Add to that low water levels in the Mississippi creating higher barge rates and higher prices at the port for importers, and the problem is compounded. Yet, it is likely just a matter of time before demand picks up. Drier weather in Argentina is already a concern. The key in the months ahead is how southern hemisphere weather affects production as well as energy prices, the war, and the U.S. dollar. Common sense suggests that weather will have the greatest impact on a trader's mindset. \\xa0SOYBEAN HIGHLIGHTS:\\xa0Soybean futures closed sharply lower after being dragged down by bean oil which closed limit down. News from the EPA regarding changes in biofuel obligations did not sit well with traders and bean oil got hammered despite crude oil having a higher close. Jan soybeans lost 39-3/4 cents to end the session at 14.29-3/4, and Mar lost 38-3/4 cents at 14.36-3/4.Soybeans fell hard today prompted by a huge sell-off in bean oil. The EPA made an announcement regarding RVO biofuel mandates for 2023-2025 in which they proposed increases in U.S. biofuel use over the next three years with volumes for 2023 at 20.8 billion gallons, 21.87 for 2024, and 22.68 for 2025. Trade was looking for higher volume, but the EPA’s numbers were still above expectations. This sell-off seemed like an overreaction and it would not be surprising to see prices recover tomorrow. The other bearish factor for bean oil right now is Russia and Ukraine unloading sunflower oil on the market, which is much cheaper than bean oil, and the price differences between the two are the widest seen in over 9 months. Export sales for last week were 25.5 mb, but shipments were strong at 77.8 mb and were primarily to China, the Netherlands, and Spain. So far for 22/23 export commitments are slightly higher than the previous year while shipments are still down 10%. Argentina’s soy dollar program is in effect and China is rumored to have purchased 6 to 7 cargoes of Argentinian beans for December through January. So far Argentinian farmers have sold 44 mb of beans, but the program has not been as successful as it was in September, likely because the majority of beans were sold then on that incentive. Mar beans are back in their trading range but at the bottom of it, and just above support at the 50-day moving average. Bean oil will have expanded limits tomorrow due to the limit down close.WHEAT HIGHLIGHTS:\\xa0Wheat futures gave up a good chunk of ground today as they were pulled lower by soybeans and U.S. exports continue to lag. Mar Chi lost 12-1/2 cents, closing at 7.83, and Jul down 8-1/4 at 8.00-1/2. Mar KC lost 9-1/2 cents, closing at 8.90-1/4, and Jul down 6-1/4 at 8.77-1/2.Most of yesterday’s gains were wiped out today. Lower corn and soybeans didn’t help. A limit down move in bean oil may have been brought on by news that credits may be given to electric vehicles in terms of renewable biofuel mandates. This led to sharply lower soybeans which added to pressure for wheat and corn. The US Dollar Index was also sharply lower today, but that did not seem to matter for wheat. Bear spreading was noted for both Chi and KC contracts, which may indicate that supply down the road is still a concern. Currently, U.S. exports have been struggling as offers out of the Black Sea are $45 cheaper per ton for soft wheat. The discrepancy is even greater when looking at HRW wheat, with offers almost $100 per ton lower than at the U.S. Gulf. The USDA reported an increase of just 5.7 mb of wheat export sales for 22/23 and 0.3 mb for 23/24. Export commitments are now at 494 mb and the 22/23 export estimate is 775 mb. In other news, the US House voted to avoid a railway strike, but as of this writing, the Senate still needs to vote on the legislation. The December 9 deadline for the strike is fast approaching. From a weather perspective, Argentina and the U.S. southern plains are still too dry but conditions may improve after the first\\xa0of the year. As a final item of note, funds are estimated to be net short about 66,000 contracts of Chi wheat.CATTLE HIGHLIGHTS:\\xa0Live cattle futures finished mixed, and feeders saw some buying strength as cash trade developed and a weak grain market helped support cattle futures. Dec finished 0.025 lower to 153.050, and Feb slipped 0.250 to 155.425. Feeders saw strong buying strength as Jan feeders gained 0.600 to 181.075.The live cattle market was choppy, digesting the cash trade totals building this week. Southern trade saw additional business at $155, and northern trade was pushing $157, both fully steady with last week. Some northern dress trade reached $249, up $4 from the last week. The steady to firmer tone helped support the market. Most trade is likely in place for the week with some exceptions of clean-up trade on Friday. Beef carcasses found some footing at midday. Choice carcasses gained 0.23 to 255.11 and select added 1.97 to 225.98 on light movement of 87 midday loads. The USDA released weekly export sales numbers on Thursday morning. Last week saw new sales of 15,400 MT for 2022 and 2,000 MT for 2023. China returned to the market as the top buyer of U.S. beef last week, followed by Canada and South Korea. Feeders traded sharply higher, following through on yesterday's strength, supported by weak grain markets. The Feeder Cattle Index gained 0.03 to 178.43.\\xa0 Feeder prices broke support this week but have quickly recovered to be trading higher on the week. The cattle market has found some footing in the second half of the week and is looking to end the week with good gains on Friday after rejecting early week lows.LEAN HOG HIGHLIGHTS:\\xa0Lean hog futures finished sharply higher on short covering and technical buying, closing with strong triple-digit gains on the session. Dec hogs, held in check by the cash market, gained 0.225 to 83.125 and Feb jumped 3.850 higher to 89.200.Feb contract posted a bullish reversal on the charts yesterday, and that triggered additional buying strength on Thursday. Prices quickly moved higher during the session, and Feb hogs are back to the price levels the market closed at last week. Dec hogs are moving closer to expiration on 12/14 and stay tied to the cash market and the index. The Lean Hog Index was softer, losing another 0.32 to 83.89. The cash index and Dec futures are trading mostly in line, which should limit gains or losses for the Dec futures.\\xa0 Feb is building a strong premium to the cash market, anticipating a turn higher in cash trade in the first quarter. Last year, Feb hogs bottomed and turned higher on December 8 and rallied into the Feb close. Direct cash trade was softer, losing 1.14 to 85.06 and a 5-day rolling average of 84.79.\\xa0 Retail values at midday today were firmer, gaining 0.28 to 87.61. The load count was moderate at 145 loads. USDA released weekly export sales on Thursday morning. Last week, new net sales totaled 20,100 MT for 2022 and an additional 3,800 MT for 2023. Japan, South Korea, and the Dominican Republic were the top buyers of U.S. pork last week. The strong rejection of lower prices just signals that the market is anticipating firmer strength going into 2023. The fundamentals are the lagging piece at this time.\\nOn the date of publication, Matt Strelow did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

       "  \"ONE44 Analytics where the analysis is concise and to the pointOur goal is to not only give you actionable information, but to help you understand why we think this is happening based on pure price analysis with Fibonacci retracements,\\xa0that we believe are the underlying structure of\\xa0all\\xa0markets\\xa0and Gann squares.Soybeans(ZSF23) (ZSH23)\\xa0The big move down in the Soybeans and Soybean Oil came from 78.6% retracements.\\xa0 The 78.6% retracement can cause very wide swings and be the beginning and end to Bull runs. This is what we put out Wednesday morning to our Premium Members,Overall this market remains in a very positive position by being above the long term swing point (1303.00) and it is building a very big base for the next run up (in our opinion). As you have seen since July this market is in a big trading range that has been doing a lot of 61.8% to 61.8% moves and 78.6% to 78.6% and we can see the wide sweeping moves continuing for the next monthThe January contract hit the first target of 1455.00 and we are still looking for the next major Gann square above at 1500.50 on the rally from the previous one at 1412.25, however with the quote above we have to watch 78.6% at 1480.50 to see if this market is going to continue with its wide swings between the 78.6% levels. In the March contract it hit 78.6% at 1480.00, this was our longer term target.\\xa0For now use \\xa01481.00 as the swing point in the Jan. and 1480.00 in the March. We know following the ONE44 78.6% rule, that a break from 78.6% can send it 78.6% the other way, so in the Jan. the long term target is 1386.00 and in the March it is 1395.00. The short term targets on a setback from here is 38.2% at 1433.00 in Jan. and 1442.00 in the March, holding these levels would be a very strong sign for the market.In Soybean Oil we said,(ZLZ22) (ZLF23)\\xa0December Oil hit the 76.64 major Gann square and 78.6% at 77.10.In the January contract it also hit 78.6% and a major Gann square at 74.45. We will now use the 78.6% levels as swing points.Below it, the longer term target is 38.2% in both these markets at 69.50 in Dec. and 67.85 in Jan. The short term target will be one major Gann square back at 72.40 in Dec. and 70.19 in Jan.You can find more about how to use the Fibonacci retracements with the ONE44 rules and guidelines in our newest video just released and based on today's action.VIDEO LINK\\xa0FULL RISK DISCLOSURE: Futures trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor.

       "  \"“Shootin’ The Bull”End of Day Market Recapby Christopher Swift12/1/2022\\u200b\\u200bLive Cattle:Until corn broke from the end of October high, cattle feeders were perplexed with the high price of corn, and threat of higher.\\xa0 Today, corn is of less a factor and the feeder cattle price becoming more so. Traders squeezed cattle feeders a little tighter today.\\xa0 I anticipate them to continue as I believe it will be difficult to entice the consumer to be willing to pay a higher price for beef, while supplies of slaughter cattle dwindle. Therefore, cattle prices are not anticipated to rise sharply, but feeder cattle prices are.\\xa0 Hence the spread between the two is anticipated to reduce profit margins to cattle feeders.\\xa0 Note that the spread between starting feeder and finishing fat bottomed this week.\\xa0 Therefore, you are at the forefront of this believed change in trend of the spread.\\xa0 As well, although back month premiums remain wide, there is nothing like the basis available to you in the spring months as has been in the past.\\xa0 So, nothing states that basis can't widen back out negatively and create a wider basis to converge as expiration nears per respective contract month.\\xa0 This would benefit backgrounder's and be detrimental to cattle feeders.\\xa0 I recommend cattle feeders own the January $180.00 calls and sell the January $172.00 puts.\\xa0 This is a sales solicitation.\\xa0 I recommend you plan your actions for inventory needed in March, April, and May while basis is better than in the past and spreads to the finished fats believed having bottomed this week. \\xa0We believe our clearing firm, ADMIS, provides superior back-office management of clients' accounts through the OAK and NEXUS platforms. We believe our knowledge of these platforms, specific market knowledge, and desire to achieve the information needed to make the most informed decision, is of great benefit to you and your operation. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\u200bFeeder Cattle:Follow through was seen today in the feeder market.\\xa0 The minor wave count leads me to anticipate a top at around $183.00 January.\\xa0 From there, a minor wave 2 correction will be anticipated.\\xa0 I will be looking to make recommendations on the spring months were this to unfold as anticipated. \\xa0I recommend buying the $180.00 January call and selling the January $172.00 put.\\xa0 This is a sales solicitation.\\u200bI recommend exiting all short call options and maintaining the long put options.\\xa0 This is a sales solicitation.\\xa0\\u200bI recommend selling the $10.00 out of the money put against any long put you may have in the spring months to convert the previous fence options hedge into a bear put spread.\\xa0 This is a sales solicitation.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Lean Hogs:The lean hog index was down $.32 at $83.89.\\xa0 Hog futures were higher to sharply higher across the board.\\xa0Corn:Day 11 started the breakout to the downside.\\xa0 December, September and red December all exceeded the low produced on November 15th.\\xa0 I anticipate the closer in months of corn to follow suit.\\xa0 On the mid day cattle comment, I made the recommendation to sell red December corn at the market with a buy stop to exit only at $6.15.\\xa0 This is a sales solicitation.\\xa0 A weather forecast, I deemed credible, suggests the La Nina pattern to be broken and the start of a El Nino pattern forming that will be anticipated to break the drought in March of '23.\\xa0 This would go a long way in relieving some of the bullishness on new crop corn. \\xa0Beans broke sharply with the bean oil limit down in some contract months.\\xa0 Meal was able to hold its own.\\xa0 Wheat remains in a down trend with anticipation of lower trading.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Energy:Energies were higher through the early session and closed lower on the products and well off the highs in crude.\\xa0 I anticipate energy prices to soften.\\xa0 I do not recommend topping off farm tanks and do not wish to contract any more fuel just yet.\\xa0 No doubt, I may be wrong, and there is even less doubt of the volatility the world is in that could cause this to be void overnight. I urge you to take these comments in consideration of these factors. Other than that, I look for energy to soften. \\xa0 \\xa0Bonds:Bonds were up sharply today.\\xa0 Equities were soft.\\xa0 The US dollar index was down sharply.\\xa0 The lower dollar and higher bonds are seemingly inflationary factors, but the commodities are not responding in a like manner today by trading higher.\\xa0 I won't think too hard over this as we may see retail inflation remain while wholesale inflation softens.\\xa0\\u200bThis is intended to be or is in the nature of a solicitation. An investment in futures contracts is speculative, involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for persons who can assume the risk of loss in excess of the margin deposits.\\xa0 You should carefully consider whether futures trading is appropriate for you in light of your investment experience, trading objectives, financial resources and other relevant circumstances. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOn the date of publication, Chris Swift did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

       "  'Thursday soy trade has the board working sharply lower. Soybean prices are 2.2% to 2.9% in the red with double digit drops of as much as 43 cents. Soybean oil is leading the way lower with 6.4% to 7.6% losses thus far through midday. Meal prices are also red, though firmer on 0.17% to 0.5% losses.\\xa0The EPA boosted required biofuel use to 20.82b gallons of renewable fuels for 2023, of which 5.82 billion would be advanced biofuels (mostly from soy oil). The prior requirement was 20.63b gallons, so the 2023 number is just a ~1% increase. ASA and other farm groups are disappointed by the minimal increases, as well as some loopholes in RIN creation.\\xa0Weekly Export Sales from the week that ended 11/24 were confirmed at 693,838 MT. Analysts were expecting to see at least 550k MT. China was the top buyer, with 110k MT previously announced. China was also the destination for over half (71%) of the week’s export, which was 2.1 MMT to all destinations. The accumulated soybean export reached 19 MMT (700.5 mbu) through 11/24.FAS data had soymeal sales at 185k MT, compared to 516k MT last week and\\xa0 150 – 500k MT expected. Accumulated soymeal exports were 1.494 MMT through 11/24, trailing last year by 19.3%. In BO the weekly report showed 2,306 MT of net cancelations, compared to pre-report estimates of 0-20k MT. Soy oil exports were at 11,474 MT for the season through 11/24 – trailing last year by 78%.\\xa0Analysts estimate the NASS Fats and Oils report on Thursday afternoon will show 195.9 mbu (a 10-mo high) of soybeans were processed during October.
